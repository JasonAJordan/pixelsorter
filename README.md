# PixelSorter and more
## My small project about my love for digital imaging techinques 

I plan on expanding and creating diffrenet algorithims for digital imaging techinques. 

First one is more of a proof of concept using both AI for facial detection and pixelsorting
To run the face pixel sort, change the fileInName and fileOutName on lines 10 and 11 within the file "faceOnlyPixelsort.py" then run the file
